  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there, my name is Joshua Barnachea and I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer with a background in Digital Marketing and experience as a Virtual Assistant and Customer Service Representative.</p>

<p>I am currently an undergraduate student studying Pharmacy. In 2019, I worked as a customer service representative for a BPO company and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. However, due to various circumstances including the Covid-19 surge in our country, I resigned from my job in June of 2020 and returned to college to complete my degree.</p>

<p>To receive my degree, I must pass my last two subjects/programs, which are my thesis and my review (preparation for the board exam). Unfortunately, my university does not currently offer the thesis program due to the need for lab experiments, which are not allowed during the lockdown in our country.</p>

<p>
  In addition to my customer service experience, I have also worked as a Virtual Assistant for a startup business in the United States. I am now focused on learning how to code and working hard to break into the tech industry.
